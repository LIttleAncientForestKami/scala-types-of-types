Obviously this vademecum required quite a bit of reseach and double-checking, so here are all the links I've found helpful (and you might too).

* Twitter's Scala School: http://twitter.github.io/scala_school quite a bit of Scala concepts. Which helped me a lot in nicely explaining Variance (nicest explanation I found, since "ever").
* Very old, but still valid explanation of Universal Types: http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/128
* Existential Types by D.R. MacIver: http://www.drmaciver.com/2008/03/existential-types-in-scala/
