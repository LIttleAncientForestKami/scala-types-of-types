== Enumeration +++<span style="color:red">&#x2717;</span>+++

Scala does not have a build in "enum" like Java does. 
Instead we use a few tricks (embedded in Enumeration) to write something pretty similar.

=== Enumeration
WARNING: TODO write me :-)

First explain the good ol' Enumeration <<enumeration>>:

```scala
object Main extends App {

  object WeekDay extends Enumeration {
    type WeekDay = Value
    val Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun = Value
  }
  import WeekDay._

  def isWorkingDay(d: WeekDay) = ! (d == Sat || d == Sun)

  WeekDay.values filter isWorkingDay foreach println
}
```

=== @enum

Together with annotation macros, we may be getting the `@enum` annotation, which is descibed somewhat in the related Scala Improvement Process document: <<enum-sip>>.

WARNING: TODO write me

```scala
@enum
class Day {
  Monday    { def goodDay = false }
  Tuesday   { def goodDay = false }
  Wednesday { def goodDay = false }
  Thursday  { def goodDay = false }
  Friday    { def goodDay = true  }
  def goodDay: Boolean
}
```
