== Type Alias

It's not really another kind of type, but a trick we can use to make our code more readable:

```scala
type User = String
type Age = Int

val data:  Map[User, Age] =  Map.empty
```

Using this trick the Map definition now suddenly "makes sense!". If we'd just used a `String => Int` map,
we'd make the code less readable. Here we can keep using our primitives (maybe we need this for performance etc),
but **name them** so it makes sense for the future reader of this class.
