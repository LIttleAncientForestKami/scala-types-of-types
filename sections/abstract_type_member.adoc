== Abstract Type Member

Let's now go deeper into the use cases of Type Aliases, which we call Abstract Type Members.

With Abstract Type Members we say "I expect someone to tell me about some type - I'll refer to it by the name MyType".
It's most basic function is allowing us to define generic classes (templates), but instead of using the `class Clazz[A, B]` syntax, we name them inside the class, like this:

```scala
trait SimplestContainer {
  type A      // Abstract Type Member

  def value: A
}
```

Which for Java folks may seem very similar to the `Container<A>` syntax at first, but it's a bit more powerful as we'll see in the section about <<path-dependent-type, Path Dependent Types>>, as well as in the below example.

todo; Then, this is how we would implement this trait:

```scala
object IntContainer extends SimplestContainer {
  type A = Int

  def value = 42
}
```

So we "provide the type" using a Type Alias on line 2 here, and now we can implement the value method, as its type is known.
