== Phantom Type +++<span style="color:red">&#x2717;</span>+++

WARNING: TODO, needs a lot more love. For example "really phantom types" are not explained at all -- those that we never construct.


```scala
trait Started
trait Stopped
trait StartStopState
trait Started extends StartStopState
trait Stopped extends StartStopState

class Service[State <: StartStopState] {
  def start[T >: State <: Stopped] = this.asInstanceOf[Service[Started]]
}
val x = new Serice[Stopped]()
val x = new Service[Stopped]()
x.start
res1.start
```

Now we're starting to get into the more interesting Types! :-)

Phantom Types are a mean of staticly validating your sources, during compile time.
It's used in many libraries, to prevent you from using some API, with an object in "not the right state".

To set the stage for our Phantom Type usage let's first define a `ServiceHandle` class,
and `trait`s to represent the state it is in. We want to prevent users of our API from calling `stop()` on an already
`Stopped` instance, as well as prevent them from calling `start()` on an already `Running` instance.

```scala
// the traits are expected to be only used with our ServiceHandle,
// which we nicely express using Self Type Annotations.
trait Stopped { this: ServiceHandle => }
trait Running { this: ServiceHandle => }
```

Now that we have our Types prepared, let's look at how the implementation will look like:

```scala
class ServiceHandle private (id: Id)
object ServiceHandle {
  def create(id: Id) = new ServiceHandle(id) with Stopped
}
```

Here, during instanciation of the class, we mix in the `Stopped` trait right away.
We've used this trick before in this blog post (series), but now it's finally time to explain it in detail.

Turns out that the type of this newly created ServiceHandle is not only `ServiceHandle` but...
`ServiceHandle with Stopped`. It may seem underwhelming at first that "that's it",
but let's move on to the `start` and `stop` commands to see why this us so nice interesting.

```scala
def start(s: ServiceHandle with Stopped) = {
  s.start()
  new ServiceHandle(s.id) with Running
}
```

And we can do the same for stopping a Service. Other useful methods would be,
`Id => Either[ServiceHandle with Stopped, ServiceHandle with Running]` which's implementation you can easily imagine.

```scala
def stop(s: ServiceHandle with Running) = {
  s.stop()
  new ServiceHandle(s.id) with Stopped
}
```

TODO MAKE BETTER EXAMPLES



Fun Java Fact: A similar end-result - failing during compilation - can also be done in Java, using annotation processors and Annotated types (you should check out Adam Warski's example on this if you're curious).
